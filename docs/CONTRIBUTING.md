## How can I contribute?

### Adding new questions and answers

Choose a Python subject and add questions and answers that are not already covered, or add an entirely new subject.

To add a question and its answer, simply add them in the corresponding subject's questions and answers text files.

To add a new subject, create two text files in the _subjects_ folder with the subject name followed by \_questions and \_answers. Example: _new_subject_questions.txt_ and _new_subject_answers.txt_. Then, add the subject title in the subjects list included in the constructor of the Flashcard class found in _src/flashcards.py_.
